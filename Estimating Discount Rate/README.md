# Estimating Discount Rate

Estimate discount rate using IPEDS Student Financial Aid (SFA) survey

The SFA survey has institutional grant aid for undergraduates. Combined with the number of undergraduates and the sticker price, we can estimate discount rate or net tuition revenue. This is not going to match NACUBO discount rate survey results since the NACUBO survey accounts for Tuition waivers or Tuition benefits and the IPEDS SFA does not.
